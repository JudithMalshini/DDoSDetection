Step to follow to run the code 
1. DataSet CICDDOS 2019 can be downloaded from the follwoing link,  <br /> 
(https://www.unb.ca/cic/datasets/ddos-2019.html)  <br /> 
2. Dataset needs to be placed in folder named "data1".
3. dataset_create_pre_process.ipynb - reads the dataset and pre-process the data and create a processed dataset with 1000 data per class.
4. data_feature_selection.ipnyb - features are analysed and extracted. 
5. syn_SELECITON_training_ml.ipynb - ML model is trained with feature analysis and hyper  parameter tuning. (code is implmented to be deployed on Google Colab) <br />
